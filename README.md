# question-type
Identify Question Type: Given a question, the aim is to identify the category it belongs to. The four categories to handle for this assignment are : Who, What, When, Affirmation(yes/no).
Label any sentence that does not fall in any of the above four as "Unknown" type.

Example:
1. What is your name? Type: What
2. When is the show happening? Type: When
3. Is there a cab available for airport? Type: Affirmation
There are ambiguous cases to handle as well, like:
What time does the train leave(this looks like a what question but is actually a When type)

**Detailed explaination is given with comments in the ipython notebook**
